This repository contains the code for the segmentation of white matter multiple sclerosis lesions from MRI. 
The code is developed by Biomedical Engineering and Informatics group 21gr8401 at Aalborg University for their 8th semester project in spring 2021.

The repository includes the image preprocessing pipeline for 3D MRI scans in nii.gz format. Further, three segmentation algorithms are included in this repository, namely fuzzy C-means, level-set and uNet. 

> **Note: The code comes "as is" and the 21gr8401 group is not responsible for any possible harm caused by running this program.**

The code has been implemented on Windows utilizing Anaconda as the Python distribution.
The packages which were implemented by other groups or packages which are integrated in Python modules are referenced in the project itself. The project can be found at the Aalborg University Project Library.
